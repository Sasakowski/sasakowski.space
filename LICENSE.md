# License of this repository's contents

Code-wise, it's free to use for any other project.

I'd heavily refrain from using anything else, like images, because they're mostly likely subject to copyright (which I consider not within the scope of code).

I personally don't consider my coding philosophies or 'handwriting' worthy of being copied. It's not like my actual handwriting is any better.
