# Static Folder

This directory is empty on GitHub, because this is where (large) files are stored.<br>
This is to prevent heavy-weight uploads to/downloads from GitHub.

Why? Because dev runs on Windows and is pushed to GitHub, then live is pulled from GitHub to a Linux system.<br>
A physical (analogous) transfer of files only takes place when neccessary.
