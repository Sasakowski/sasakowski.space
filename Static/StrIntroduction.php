			<space></space>
			<text>The <i>Strimaginus Project</i> is an international story-writing endeavour with a heavy focus on collaborative fiction and source documentation with the help of specialized tools, including home-grown ones.
				
			Collaborative fiction is when two or more people create one work: the ownership is divided among them.
			A story's source material is its backstage: it holds the answers to the most fundamental questions: who? what? where? when? why? how? context, intentions, ideas, lore, inspirations, sources, math, and so on. Knowing a story's source material means destroying all the tension the work could've produced initially. A work can also be another work's source material.

			<text_l class = "HEADER">Social structure</text_l>
			
			<space></space>
			
			<text>The members of the Strimaginus project are divided into three groups that actively participate, plus one that doesn't.</text>
			<space></space>
			<block3><flex_rows class = "COLLAPSIBLE">
				<text_l class = "HEADER">Groups</text_l>
				<space></space>
				<text><text_l class = "author">Authors</text_l>
				Authors are the base members of the project. They participate in the usual actions: creating stories, exchanging ideas, inspiring others, and so on.

				<text_l class = "orchestrator">Orchestrators</text_l>
				Orchestrators are staff members with executive duties. The exact duty/duties and therefor given permission(s) depend on the position. Some orchestrators may have more priviliges than others.
				For example: overseeing the social behaviour of others.
				
				<text_l class = "superorchestrator">Superorchestrators</text_l>
				Superorchestrators are staff members with administrative duties, as in: operating/maintaining foundational parts of the project.
				For example: this website functions as a vital platform for the project, storing story-related information and offering a platform for social activities between members.
				
				<text_l class = "reader">Readers</text_l>
				Readers are the passive members of the project. They sit at the same privilige-related level as authors, but without any 'writing priviliges'.
				</text>
			</flex_rows></block3>
			
			<space_l></space_l>

			<text>The project partially operates behind closed doors, meaning that a registration at the lowest level (that is: the reader group) is required to view, at least parts, of said operations.</text>
			<space></space>
			<block3><flex_rows class = "COLLAPSIBLE">
				<text_l class = "HEADER">Registering</text_l>
				<space></space>
				<text>An aspiring person cannot register themselves (as in: automatically by filling out and submitting a form).
				Rather, a person must submit a request to the project's staff, starting a manual registering process that ends with the creation of an account.
				
				In this process, the aspiring person is 'checked out' to determine wether they'd fit into the project's landscape.
				A background check is performed (a bad background doesn't neccessarily result in an instant decline) and the aspiring person is put up to a vote where all members may partake in (2/3rds majority).
				There is no set limit to the maximum duration of a registration process. There's also no set minimum of apparent artistic/writing expertise, experience or amount of prior works.
				There is also no set limit for registration attempts a single person may attempt (after being refused).
				
				If an active role is aspired to:
				1) the aspiring person should have:
				=> a reason or motivation to participate in the project.
				=> something to 'put onto the table' immediately. As in: authors aren't initiated on the basis of nothing.
				2) the aspiring person should be ready to:
				=> tolerate the project's not-in-a-hurry, sharing-is-caring and no-money-on-the-table mindsets.
				=> acknowledge and tolerate other members potentially using their materials. Inspiration yes, plagiarism no.
				=> cooperate with other members, especially when their own stuff is the topic of discussion or being used.
				=> partake in votes.

				If a passive role is aspired to:
				1) the aspiring person should have:
				=> a general interest in the current works and possibly future works of the project.
				2) the aspiring person should be ready to:
				=> partake in votes.

				As of now, there are no methods of communication for uninitiated people. These will be created when the time is right.

				<text_l class = "HEADER">Hierarchy of stories</text_l>
				<space></space>
				<text>The works of the Strimaginus project are organized into an hierarchy of <i>sections</i>, so-called <i>maginuses</i> (singular: <i>maginus</i>).
				A maginus may be connected with another and multiple maginuses may combine into an opera of sorts. In such a case, one maginus is usually 'subservient' to the other.

			<block3><flex_rows class = "COLLAPSIBLE">
				<text_l class = "HEADER">Age rating & marking</text_l>
				<space></space>
				<text>The Strimaginus project categorizes all works into one of four age ratings.
				Note that age ratings do not determine wether a work is really meant for its supposed age group. If, say, a work is age rated for children and is intended for children, it must be marked accordingly.
				
				<quote>Stressor</quote>: a thing that causes a person to experience stress, which can cause positive or negative effects. A work can be filled to the brim with negative stressors, depictions of 'bad things' are an example.
				Adolescents and, God forbid, children are never to be confronted with negative stressors, which can provoke life-altering developments (most often for the worse).
				
				<text_l>Pure</text_l>
				Pure-rated works or 'pure works' contain virtually no stressors. They have barely any complexity and are very easy to understand.
				These works are usually appropriate for children, but must be marked appropriately if the work is specifically intended for them.

				<text_l>Softcore</text_l>
				Softcore-rated or 'softcore works' contain weak stressors. They also start being complex and require some light effort to get behind.
				These works are usually appropriate for older children, but must be marked appropriately if the work is specifically intended for them.
				
				<text_l>Mediumcore</text_l>
				Mediumcore-rated or 'mediumcore works' contain moderate stressors. They churn up the temperature: they are complex and contain sophisticated worlds and stories, but still simple enough for a teenager to understand.
				These works are usually appropriate for adolescents, but must be marked appropriately if the work is specifically intended for them.
				Parental guidance is always recommended.
				
				<text_l>Hardcore</text_l>
				Hardcore-rated or 'hardcore works' contain the strongest stressors. Some examples are <i>extreme violence</i>, <i>immensely complicated</i> and <i>politically dense</i>.
				These works are only for adults, and must not be marked for any younger age group.
				Adolescents and especially children aren't going to understand these works and are even very likely to be negatively affected by them.
				
				
				Accounts are also age rated. Here it works in a pyramid-like way: if an account is rated mediumcore, then that account can only view works rated mediumcore and below. One can go down, but never up.
				</text>

			<space_l></space_l>
			<block3><flex_rows class = "COLLAPSIBLE">
				<text_l class = "HEADER">Code of work conduct</text_l>
				<space></space>
				<text>A work must have:
				1) artistic value or 'worth'.
				2) originality.
				3) an respectful amount of effort and passion behind it. It can also be low if it's justified.
				
				A work must:
				1) stay true to its source material (if given).
				2) not contain glaring errors, such as great causal breakages or horrible logical failures.
				3) stay true to its theme and contain what it's advertised for.
				4) only contain what is appropriate for its target audience and given age rating.
				
				A work must be sufficiently age-marked - preferably at the start, before the work itself starts.
				If a work is not intended for a specific age group, despite what it's age rating would say, it must be marked accordingly.
				
				Additionally refer to the <i>adult content</i> section below.

			<space_l></space_l>
			<block3><flex_rows class = "COLLAPSIBLE">
				<text_l class = "HEADER">Adult content</text_l>
				<space></space>
				<text>As the header implies, there are things inappropriate for children and adolescents. Sometimes referred to as adult-only, NSFW or even NSFL.
				However, adult content is more than that. If a work delves DEEP into complex fields - say sciene, politics, philosophy, morals, religion, etc. -, it's NOT good for adolescents, let alone children.
				
				The Strimaginus project has no set rule that defines what topics are disallowed. It relies more on execution than the topic itself.
				
				Some adult topics are 'heavier' or are more upsetting than others: innuendo vs sex, abuse vs rape, murder vs mass murder, war vs genocide, dictatorships vs dystopia, depression vs suicide, horror vs cosmic horror.
				No matter what the adult topic is, it must have a concise and clear purpose. A work must live up to its adult topics. And finally, a work must deal with its adult topics fairly, without playing these topics down or representing them as positive, when they are clearly not.

			<block3><flex_rows class = "COLLAPSIBLE">
				<text_l class = "HEADER">Work submission & edits & removal</text_l>
				<space></space>
				<text>Any member (author and above) can submit a work to be released under the Strimaginus project's name. Only finished works are eligible for submission.
				
				The submission process starts with an initial submission, which is first looked at by the project's staff. If a work passes this initial check, a project-wide vote determines the final decision.
				Note: if a work is rated at mediumcore, then only accounts rated mediumcore and above can partake in that work's vote.
				
				A work may fail its submission for an arbitrary reason, but may be resubmitted after the fact. A refusal is always accompanied by a reason.
				
				
				The Strimaginus project supports editing works after their initial release, which includes rewriting them. Also known as 'retconning', it's meant to allow for authors to change past works, if they wish for present-day works to go a certain direction. which would otherwise contradict past works.
				It's a whole logical process that comes from stories being able to cross-reference each other. Such a web of connections can get complicated when many works over many years are involved.
				
				Works can also have their release status voided, possibly suddenly. This can happen because of things that weren't in effect at the time of release, say a controversy of gargantuan proportions or a present-day work 'killing' an older work. 
				
				A work can also be entirely deleted.

			<text><text_l>Legalities</text_l>
			Some things concerning legal matters. All active members of the Strimaginus project must have read and understood this document and its implications.
			
			<text_l>In reference to ages and personal data</text_l>
			It's no new recognition that it's <i>ludicrously</i> easy to lie on the internet. There's nothing easier, that can be done on the web, than that.
			If a person wants to participate and offer their time to the project, they won't get around a registration. A registration doesn't require any personally identifiable information, nor should it be supplied.

			An account contains the following information:
			- a username, which are unique(ly identifiable), so they should be chosen carefully.
			- a password (must not be similar to passwords, which were used in the past).
			- a unique combination of three so-called 'account keys'. An account key is a select one out of thirty-two animal names.
			- the rank (author, orchestrator, superorchestrator or reader).
			- the status (active, inactive, banned).
			- the age rating (pure, softcore, mediumcore or hardcore).
			- the timezone: UTC-12 to UTC+14. Any can be picked, if the wish for unidentifiableness is there. UTC+3 is the timezone of the website.
			
			The scarcity of personally identifiable information keeps the damage of a leak, such as a database leak, as low as possible: there won't be any data of value to be found and sold.
			It's entirely up to a member to choose to engage with any other method of communication, such as via E-Mail or Discord. These will be set-up in the future.

			If a person reveals their private information through any way, it must be removed either by themselves or by administrative force.
			When revealing in secret or for malicious purposes, none other than themselves are to be held responsible. It's only a problem once it's made aware of.

			A person may request the deletion of their account at any time for any reason (the right to be forgotten). In this case, they may demand that all of their submitted content (including within archives and back-ups) to be purged.
			
			<text_l>In reference to copyright</text_l>
			All works, may it be stories, characters, ideas and so on, are protected by copyright by default. Submitting something to the project doesn't free said something from its copyright protection.
			Each member must define their personal rules in regards to the material they may submit to the project. Think of it as each member having their own terms of use. Not doing so or defining terms that harm the spirit of the project are a rule violation. These terms of use are stored on an account's profile page.
			
			All members are responsible for protecting their personal copyrights. It's entirely up to the individual to monitor and act upon whenever their rights have been violated.
			This doesn't mean that they won't be assisted. If a third party notices a copyright violation (even if it's not relevant to them), it must be reported like any other violation that has been sighted.
			
			EVERYTHING a member submits to the project should be original. Unless explicit permission is given, already copyrighted material (as in: fan material from established IPs that have no affiliation with the Strimaginus project) shouldn't be used.

			A personal terms of use must contain the following things at least:
			- The grant to other members of the project to use one's copyrighted material without having to anticipate or fear legal action.
			- If the desire is there, to what extend can one's copyrighted material be used for? Where are the limits? What is disallowed?
			- Wether a member must ask for permission first (before using one's copyrighted material).
			- Wether people outside the projet (as in: unaffiliated) can use the copyrighted material.
			- Wether the copyrighted material can be used for things outside the project entirely.
			- Wether the copyrighted material can be used for commercial gain.

			<text_l>In reference to money</text_l>
			The Strimaginus project has no commercial character. It has no budget and all of its content should generally be produced and made available for free.
			
			Making money off of a work released under the Strimaginus project depends on wether its creator(s) allow it. If you want to make money, get ready to potentially read and keep track of a lot of terms of uses.
			
		
		
			Privacy:
				1) the database of the project can be accessed by its superorchestrator without limitations:
				=> access to ALL accounts and their information.
				=> ALL comments posted onto the forum.
				=> EVERYTHING given by members on their respective profile pages.
