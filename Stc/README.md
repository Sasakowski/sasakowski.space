# Static Folder

This directory is empty on GitHub, because this is where (large) files are stored.<br>
This is to prevent heavy-weight *push*s and *pull*s to/from GitHub.

Why? Dev is created on Windows, and live runs on Linux. GitHub is used to transfer in between the two.<br>
If neccessary, static files are transferred using an analogous method.
